What are creepy pastas?

Creepypasta are essentially internet horror stories, passed around on forums and other
sites to disturb and frighten readers. The name "Creepypasta" comes from the word "copypasta",
 an internet slang term for a block of text that gets copied and pasted over and over again
 from website to website. Creepypastas are sometimes supplemented with pictures, audio and/or
 video footage related to the story, typically with gory, distorted, or otherwise shocking content.
